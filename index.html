                    Artemis Program: Everything you need to know about NASA's Artemis program!
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Nasa's Artemis project aims to land the first woman and the next man on the moon. 
                    Here we provided everything you need to know about the Artemis program. 
                    NASA is planning for a successful land in the year 2024. 
                    For 49 long years, human civilization is going to set foot on the moon again. 
                    This will open a new era of space exploration.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <h2>What is NASA's Artemis program?</h2>

                <p>
                    Artemis is a US government-funded international human spaceflight program aimed at 
                    landing by 2024, especially in the lunar Arctic. This program will play a huge role in 
                    the next Mars journey. The Artemis program is contracted by NASA, the US space agency, 
                    and various international commercial space flight institutes.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>


                <p>
                    NASA contracted international agencies are working for the development of various 
                    parts of the mission. NASA is leading the program but expects international 
                    partnerships to play a key role. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <p>
                    Long-term goals include building an expedition team and a sustainable presence on the moon, 
                    laying the groundwork for private companies to build a lunar economy, 
                    and eventually sending people to Mars. 
                    In December 2016, the then US President Donald Trump approved Space Policy Guide-1.

                <h2>
                    Why NASA is going back to the moon?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    NASA isn't trying to repeat the Apollo mission 
                    but creating its own rhythm to investigating living possibilities on mars. 
                    NASA believes that for going to mars NASA must go to the moon. 
                    NASA will test a few things. 
                    Here are provided some key factors which are NASA trying to get by this mission.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Technology:</b> 
                    From rocket science to home science, technology has advanced in its way. 
                    NASA will check this technology in the Artemis project. 
                    Nowadays SpaceX's rocket technology is a trending topic all over the internet.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Equality: </b> 
                    One of the main intentions of the Artemis program is to land the first woman and the 
                    next man on the moon. This will clear the equality of gender division.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Partnership: </b> 
                    Artemis project will set a new economy on the space will the commercial partner such as 
                    SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing, and more.

                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Long-term presence: </b> 
                    In the last Apollo mission astronauts just spent three days on the moon surface. 
                    NASA is planning to build a base on Mars to extend all lunar mission duration, 
                    it could be a week or probably a month or more!


                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Knowledge: </b> 
                    This mission will help NASA to increase their practical knowledge about space's 
                    extreme environment and lunar environment. NASA says that this time we can collect 
                    our sample more strategically.


                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                    <b style="color: blue;">Resources: </b> 
                    Artemis's mission will help the world to solve the mystery about water presence in the 
                    lunar arctic area. If the sign is "YES", then it will create a new economic system with 
                    the moon, with the help of commercial space agencies.

                        Artemis program and create a partnership to create a new economy in space.

                        Two kinds of space suites will be used for the Artemis program.

                        Exploration Extravascular Mobility Unit (xEMU): </b> 
                        This is a state-of-the-art spacesuit that will land astronauts on the surface of 
                        the moon, solving various problems of the Apollo suite. Astronauts will stay on the 
                        moon wearing this spacesuit.


                    </p>

                        Orion True Survival System (OCSS):  </b> 
                        This is an emergency suite, if an accident occurs or astronauts have to make an 
                        emergency landing in space or on Earth without a rescue team, then it will help the 
                        astronauts help to survive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Especially, when Orion has a splashdown on the sea of earth, astronauts will enter 
                        earth's atmosphere wearing this spacesuit.
